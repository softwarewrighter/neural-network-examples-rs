# Incremental Learning Path: From Backprop to TRM

This document outlines a step-by-step learning path from our current state (basic feedforward networks with backpropagation) to advanced recursive reasoning models like TRM.

---

## Current State (✅ COMPLETE)

**What We Have:**
- 3-layer feedforward networks (input → hidden → output)
- Sigmoid activation
- Basic backpropagation (SGD)
- Boolean logic examples (AND, OR, XOR)
- Simple arithmetic (half-adder, full-adder)
- Parity and majority functions
- Checkpoint save/load
- SVG visualization

**What We Can Do:**
- Train on small datasets (~8 examples)
- Solve linearly/non-linearly separable problems
- Visualize network structure and weights

**Limitations:**
- Only sigmoid activation
- Only SGD optimizer
- No recurrence/memory
- No iterative refinement
- Single-shot prediction

---

## The Gap to TRM

**TRM Requires:**
1. Multiple activations (ReLU, GELU)
2. Better optimizers (Adam)
3. Deeper networks (4+ layers)
4. Recursive processing (reuse same network)
5. Latent features (z - reasoning trace)
6. Answer refinement (y - progressive improvement)
7. Deep supervision (multi-step training)
8. Early stopping (halting mechanism)
9. EMA (weight averaging for stability)

**That's a LOT of new concepts!**

Let's build them incrementally, one example at a time.

---

## Phase 1: Better Optimizers & Activations (Example-4)

### Example-4a: Momentum-Based Training

**New Concept**: Momentum (accumulate gradients)

**What to Implement:**
- SGD with momentum
- Compare convergence speed to vanilla SGD
- Same XOR task, visualize training curves

**Why This Matters:**
- Foundation for Adam
- Faster convergence
- Better for deep networks

**Example Output:**
```
=== XOR with Momentum ===
Vanilla SGD: 2000 iterations to converge
SGD + Momentum: 800 iterations to converge
```

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 days

---

### Example-4b: ReLU Activation

**New Concept**: ReLU and its variants

**What to Implement:**
- ReLU activation function

**Why This Matters:**
- Standard in modern networks
- Prevents vanishing gradients
- Required for deep networks

**Example Output:**
```
=== Activation Comparison on XOR ===
Sigmoid: 1500 iterations, 0.08 final error
ReLU: 900 iterations, 0.05 final error
Leaky ReLU: 850 iterations, 0.04 final error
```

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 days

---

### Example-4c: Adam Optimizer

**New Concept**: Adaptive learning rates

**What to Implement:**
- Adam optimizer (combines momentum + RMSprop)

```

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 days

---

## Phase 2: Deeper Networks (Example-5)

### Example-5a: 4-Layer Network

**New Concept**: Deep networks (4-5 layers)

**What to Implement:**
- Extend to 4-layer architecture

**Example Output:**
```
=== 3-Layer vs 4-Layer on ARC-like Pattern ===
3-layer: 60% accuracy
4-layer: 78% accuracy
```

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 days

---

### Example-5b: Residual Connections

**New Concept**: Skip connections

**What to Implement:**
- Add residual connections (x + f(x))
- Compare gradient flow with/without
- Deeper network (6+ layers) with residuals

**Why This Matters:**
- Enables very deep networks
- Prevents gradient vanishing
- Used in TRM indirectly (deep supervision acts like residuals)

**Example Output:**
```
=== 6-Layer Networks ===
Without Residuals: Gradient vanishes, fails to train
With Residuals: Trains successfully, 85% accuracy
```

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 days

---

## Phase 3: Recurrent Processing (Example-6)

### Example-6a: Simple RNN

**New Concept**: Recurrence (reuse network over time)

**What to Implement:**
- Basic RNN cell
- Process sequence one step at a time
- Simple sequence task (e.g., count 1s in binary string)

**Why This Matters:**
- Foundation for recursive reasoning
- Understand state/memory
- Bridge to TRM's recursive loop

**Example Output:**
```
=== Sequence Tasks ===
Task: Count 1s in [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Expected: 4
RNN Output: 4 ✓
```

**Time Estimate**: 4-5 days

---

### Example-6b: Recursive Network (Reuse Same Network)

**New Concept**: Network processes its own output

**What to Implement:**
- Network f(x) applied multiple times: f(f(f(x)))

Single-pass network: 65% accuracy
3-pass recursive: 92% accuracy ⭐
```

**Time Estimate**: 4-5 days

---

## Phase 4: Latent Features & Answer Refinement (Example-7)

### Example-7a: Latent Feature Learning

**New Concept**: Separate reasoning (z) from answer (y)

**What to Implement:**
- Network maintains two features: z (latent) and y (answer)
- z = f(x, y, z)  # Update reasoning
- y = g(y, z)      # Update answer
- Simple puzzle task

**Why This Matters:**
- **This IS TRM's architecture!**
- z = "how we're thinking"
- y = "current answer"

**Example Output:**
```
=== Pattern Completion [1,2,3,?,5] ===
Initial guess: y=[1,2,3,7,5], z=random
After recursion 1: y=[1,2,3,4,5], z=learned pattern ✓
```

**Time Estimate**: 5-6 days

---

### Example-7b: Progressive Answer Refinement

**New Concept**: Iteratively improve answer

**What to Implement:**
- Start with random answer
- Recursively refine toward correct solution
- Visualize improvement over iterations
- Task: Solve simple equation (x + 2 = 5, find x)

**Why This Matters:**
- Core TRM behavior
- Self-correction mechanism
- Demonstrates "thinking"

**Example Output:**
```
=== Solving x + 2 = 5 ===
Iteration 0: x=8 (wrong)
Iteration 1: x=5 (better)
Iteration 2: x=3 (correct!) ✓
```

**Time Estimate**: 5-6 days

---

## Phase 5: Deep Supervision (Example-8)

### Example-8a: Multi-Step Supervision

**New Concept**: Train on intermediate steps, not just final answer

**What to Implement:**
- Supervision at each refinement step
- Loss = sum of losses at each step
- Detach gradients between steps
- Task: Multi-step arithmetic

**Why This Matters:**
- **Core TRM training method!**
- Learn to improve incrementally
- Effective depth without memory cost

**Example Output:**
```
=== Learning to Solve 3+2-1=? ===
Step 1: Compute 3+2=5, Loss: 0.02
Step 2: Compute 5-1=4, Loss: 0.01
Total Loss: 0.03
```

**Time Estimate**: 5-6 days

---

### Example-8b: Detached Recursion (Free Improvement Steps)

**New Concept**: Run recursions without gradients, backprop only last

**What to Implement:**
- T-1 recursions without gradients (inference only)
- 1 recursion with gradients (backprop)
- Compare memory usage: full backprop vs detached

**Why This Matters:**
- **TRM's memory efficiency trick!**
- Get deep network benefits without memory cost
- Enables very deep effective depth

**Example Output:**
```
=== Memory Comparison (10 recursion steps) ===
Full backprop: 2.4 GB memory
Detached (backprop last only): 0.3 GB memory ⭐
Same accuracy!
```

**Time Estimate**: 4-5 days

---

## Phase 6: Early Stopping & Stability (Example-9)

### Example-9a: Halting Mechanism

**New Concept**: Learn when to stop recursing

**What to Implement:**
- Q-head: Predicts "is answer correct?"
- Binary cross-entropy loss for halting
- Stop early if confidence > threshold
- Task: Variable-difficulty puzzles

**Why This Matters:**
- Efficiency (don't waste computation)
- TRM's adaptive computational time
- Model learns its own confidence

**Example Output:**
```
=== Adaptive Halting ===
Easy puzzle: Stops after 2 steps ✓
Hard puzzle: Uses all 8 steps ✓
Average: 4.3 steps (vs 8 fixed)
```

**Time Estimate**: 4-5 days

---

### Example-9b: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

**New Concept**: Average weights over time for stability

**What to Implement:**
- EMA of network weights (θ_ema = 0.999*θ_ema + 0.001*θ)
- Use EMA weights for evaluation
- Training weights for updates
- Compare stability with/without EMA

**Why This Matters:**
- Critical for small data (Sudoku has only 1K examples!)
- Prevents sharp divergence
- TRM requires this for stability

**Example Output:**
```
=== Training Stability (1000 examples) ===
Without EMA: Diverges after 40K steps
With EMA: Stable throughout, better final accuracy ⭐
```

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 days

---

## Phase 7: Full TRM (Example-10)

### Example-10: Tiny Recursion Model

**New Concept**: Combine everything!

**What to Implement:**
- 2-layer tiny network
- Recursive refinement (z and y)
- Deep supervision (N_sup steps)
- Detached recursion (T-1 free, 1 backprop)
- Halting mechanism
- EMA
- Task: Simple reasoning (pattern completion, mini-puzzles)

**All Components:**
```rust
struct TRM {
    net: TinyNetwork,  // 2-layer MLP
    input_embedding,
    output_head,
    q_head,  // Halting
}

// Recursive refinement
fn latent_recursion(x, y, z, n=6) -> (y, z)

// Deep recursion (T-1 free + 1 backprop)
fn deep_recursion(x, y, z, n=6, T=3) -> (y, z)

// Training loop
for step in 0..N_sup:
    (y, z) = deep_recursion(x, y, z)
    loss = cross_entropy(y_hat, y_true)
    loss += halting_loss(q, y_hat == y_true)
    backprop()
    if should_halt(q): break
```

**Example Output:**
```
=== Pattern Completion Task ===
Training: 100 patterns, 1000 epochs
Test Accuracy: 94%

=== Recursion Analysis ===
Average recursion depth: 4.2 / 16
Convergence: 87% of cases
```

**Time Estimate**: 7-10 days

## Recommendations

### Critical Path (Must Have):
1. **Adam optimizer** (Phase 1c) - Required for TRM
2. **Recursive network** (Phase 3b) - Core TRM concept
3. **Latent features** (Phase 4a) - TRM architecture
4. **Deep supervision** (Phase 5a) - TRM training
5. **Full TRM** (Phase 7)

### Nice to Have (But Can Skip):
- Momentum (Phase 1a) - Adam includes this
- Residual connections (Phase 2b) - TRM uses deep supervision instead
- Simple RNN (Phase 3a) - Different from TRM's recursion

### Minimum Viable Path (Fastest):
1. Adam + ReLU (Phase 1b+c: 5-7 days)
2. Recursive network (Phase 3b: 4-5 days)
3. Latent + answer (Phase 4a: 5-6 days)
4. Deep supervision basics (Phase 5a: 5-6 days)
5. Simple TRM (Phase 7: 7-10 days)

**Total minimum: 6-7 weeks**

## Where to Start?

### Option A: Follow Full Path (Recommended for Learning)
Start with Phase 1a (Momentum), build every concept incrementally

**Pros**: Deep understanding, solid foundation
**Cons**: Takes 3-4 months
**Best for**: Educational goals, thorough learning

### Option B: Critical Path Only
Skip to Adam, Recursive, Latent, Deep Supervision, TRM

**Pros**: Faster (6-7 weeks)
**Cons**: Miss some foundational concepts
**Best for**: Getting to TRM quickly

### Option C: Start with Recursive Network (Recommended!)
Jump straight to Phase 3b (Recursive Network), then backfill optimizers as needed

**Pros**: See the "magic" of recursion early (motivation!)
**Cons**: Might struggle without Adam
**Best for**: Hands-on learners who learn by doing

---

## My Recommendation

**Start with Phase 3b (Recursive Network)** using our existing sigmoid + SGD:

1. Implement recursive network on XOR chain
2. See that recursion > single-pass (motivating!)
3. Then backfill Adam (Phase 1c) to make it better
4. Then add latent features (Phase 4a)
5. Then deep supervision (Phase 5a)
6. Finally, full TRM (Phase 7)

**Why this order?**
- See results quickly (XOR chain in ~4-5 days)
- Understand WHY we need better optimizers (Adam)
- Build motivation through visible improvement
- Most engaging learning path

**Ready to start with recursive networks?**
