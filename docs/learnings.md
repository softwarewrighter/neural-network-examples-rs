# Project Learnings & Decisions

This document captures key decisions, lessons learned, and development practices for the neural network project.

## Core Principles

### Architecture Over Features

**Priority:** Clean, maintainable architecture comes before feature velocity.

**Philosophy:**
- **Small, focused crates:** Each crate should have a single, clear responsibility
- **Short, documented functions:** Functions should be concise, well-named, and thoroughly documented
- **Comprehensive testing:** Every function should have tests that validate behavior
- **Examples are secondary:** Core library quality takes precedence over example code

**Rationale:**
- **Maintainability:** Smaller modules are easier to understand and modify
- **Testability:** Short functions with clear inputs/outputs are easier to test
- **Onboarding:** New contributors can understand the codebase faster
- **Long-term velocity:** Technical debt slows development over time
- **Teaching:** Clean code teaches better patterns to learners

**Guidelines:**
1. **Crate Size:** A crate should contain related modules, not become a monolith
   - If a crate has >10 modules, consider splitting
   - Each crate should have a clear, single-sentence purpose
2. **Function Length:** Aim for <50 lines per function
   - Extract complex logic into helper functions
   - Use descriptive names that explain intent
3. **Documentation:** Every public item needs docs
   - Explain "why" not just "what"
   - Include examples for non-trivial APIs
4. **Testing:** Test coverage should be comprehensive
   - Unit tests for individual functions
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Edge cases and error conditions

**Decision Making:**
When choosing between "ship feature fast" vs "improve architecture":
- **Choose architecture** if the change affects core abstractions
- **Choose architecture** if technical debt will compound
- **Choose architecture** if it improves clarity for learners
- **Ship feature** only if architecture is already sound

**Example - Types Crate Refactor:**
Current state: neural-net-core contains both data structures AND algorithms
Better state: neural-net-types (data structures) + neural-net-core (algorithms)
Decision: Pause features, refactor architecture first ✓

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD / Red-Green-Refactor)

**Decision:** We are using a Test-Driven Development approach for all feature implementation.

**Process:**
1. **Red:** Write a failing test first that defines desired behavior
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor:** Improve code quality while keeping tests green

**Benefits:**
- Clear specification of behavior before implementation
- High test coverage by design
- Confidence when refactoring
- Better API design (tests expose awkward interfaces)
- Documentation through examples

**Example from Phase 0:**
- Wrote tests for activation functions first (sigmoid, linear)
- Implemented functions to pass tests
- Added edge case tests (extreme values)
- Refactored for performance (inline, const)

**Going Forward:**
- Phase 2 (Forward Propagation): Write tests with known input/output pairs, then implement
- Phase 3 (Backpropagation): Test gradient calculations against numerical gradients
- All new features require tests before implementation

### Continuous Integration Strategy

**Decision:** Use local CI infrastructure instead of GitHub Actions.

**Rationale:**
- GitHub Actions runs on GitHub's cloud servers (not local)
- Free tier limits: 2000 minutes/month for private repos
- Potential costs if free tier exceeded
- Project owner has dedicated local servers for CI
- Local CI provides:
  - No external service dependencies
  - Full control over build environment
  - No quota concerns
  - Faster feedback (no queue wait times)
  - Privacy for proprietary work

**Local CI Commands:**
```bash
# These can be automated in your local CI system
cargo test                      # Run all tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings     # Lint with strict warnings
cargo fmt -- --check            # Verify formatting
cargo doc --no-deps             # Build documentation
cargo bench                     # Run benchmarks (Phase 5+)
```

**Alternative CI Solutions (if needed):**
- Jenkins (self-hosted)
- GitLab CI (self-hosted)
- Drone CI (self-hosted)
- Buildkite (hybrid)

## Project Scope Evolution

## Technical Decisions

### Rust Edition and Code Style

**Decision:** Use Rust 2024 edition with latest modern idioms.

**Requirements:**
- **Edition:** 2024 (released Feb 2025 with Rust 1.85.0) specified in `Cargo.toml`
- **Zero clippy warnings:** Enforced in local CI with `-D warnings` flag
- **Modern patterns:** Follow Rust 2024 idioms and best practices

**Rust 2024 Edition Key Features:**
- **unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn:** Enabled by default - constrains unsafe actions to smallest scope
- **Async closures:** `async || {}` syntax for native async concurrency
- **Reserved `gen` keyword:** For future async generator support
- **Improved temporary handling:** Better lifetime management for temporary variables
- **Enhanced match patterns:** More ergonomic pattern matching
- **Unsafe block improvements:** Clearer unsafe boundaries
- **Cargo rust-version aware:** Better dependency resolution

**Key Patterns to Follow:**
```rust
// ✅ CORRECT: Use vec![] macro (clippy: vec_init_then_push)
let layers = vec![
    Layer::new(0, input_size, None),
    Layer::new(1, hidden_size, Some(input_size)),
    Layer::new(2, output_size, Some(hidden_size)),
];

// ❌ INCORRECT: Don't use push pattern when vec![] is clearer
let mut layers = Vec::with_capacity(3);
layers.push(Layer::new(0, input_size, None));
layers.push(Layer::new(1, hidden_size, Some(input_size)));
// ...

// ✅ CORRECT: Mark intentionally unused fields with #[allow]
#[allow(dead_code)]
targets: Option<Vec<f32>>,  // Will be used in Phase 3

// ✅ CORRECT: Use ? operator for error propagation
let data = self.load_data()?;

// ✅ CORRECT: Use inline for hot path functions
#[inline]
fn activate(&self, x: f32) -> f32 { ... }
```

**Common Clippy Warnings to Watch:**
- `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` - **Rust 2024 default:** Use nested `unsafe {}` blocks within unsafe functions
- `dead_code` - Mark unused code with `#[allow(dead_code)]` if intentional (with comment explaining why)
- `vec_init_then_push` - Use `vec![]` macro instead of push pattern
- `collapsible_if` with let_chains - **Edition 2024 gated:** Use let_chains for cleaner conditionals
- `needless_pass_by_value` - Use `&self` when appropriate
- `unnecessary_wraps` - Don't wrap Result if never fails
- `missing_docs` - Document all public APIs
- `large_enum_variant` - Box large enum variants

**Why This Matters:**
- Clippy catches common mistakes and anti-patterns
- **Edition 2024** provides latest language improvements (async closures, improved safety)
- Consistent style improves maintainability
- Following idioms makes code more familiar to Rust developers
- **Rust 2024 specifically** improves safety boundaries and async ergonomics

### Why Rust?

**Advantages:**
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions (as fast as C++)
- Excellent type system (catch bugs at compile time)
- Modern tooling (Cargo, rustfmt, clippy)
- Growing ML/scientific computing ecosystem
- Fearless concurrency (future parallelization)

**Challenges:**
- Borrow checker learning curve
- Fewer ML libraries than Python
- More verbose than Python for prototyping

**Verdict:** Worth it for production-quality, high-performance ML code.

### Why ndarray?

**Decision:** Use `ndarray` crate for multi-dimensional arrays.

**Rationale:**
- Most mature Rust array library
- Similar API to NumPy (familiar)
- BLAS/LAPACK integration (fast linear algebra)
- Memory layout control (row-major, column-major)
- Good interop with other crates
- Active maintenance

**Alternatives Considered:**
- `nalgebra` - More focused on linear algebra, less ML-oriented
- Manual `Vec<Vec<f32>>` - Poor cache locality, no BLAS

### Rust Borrowing Patterns for Performance

**Critical Principle:** Avoid cloning large data structures in performance-critical paths.

**Problem:** When working with mutable and immutable borrows simultaneously, the naive solution is to clone data to satisfy the borrow checker. However, cloning large arrays (like weight matrices) on every forward pass is O(n*m) and doesn't scale.

**Solution Pattern - Compute Then Write:**
```rust
// ❌ INCORRECT: Cloning large arrays
let weights_clone = weights.clone(); // O(n*m) - too expensive!
let inputs = layer.inputs_mut();
for col in 0..num_neurons {
    for row in 0..num_prev {
        sum += prev_outputs[row] * weights_clone[[row, col]];
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Compute in scope, then write
let new_inputs: Vec<f32> = {
    let weights = layer.weights()?; // Immutable borrow
    (0..num_neurons)
        .map(|col| {
            (0..num_prev)
                .map(|row| prev_outputs[row] * weights[[row, col]])
                .sum()
        })
        .collect()
}; // Borrow ends here - only O(n) temporary allocation
*layer.inputs_mut() = new_inputs; // Single mutable borrow
```

**Key Techniques:**
1. **Scope borrows:** Use `{ }` blocks to end borrows before taking new ones
2. **Compute-then-write:** Calculate all results with immutable borrows, then write with one mutable borrow
3. **Iterator chains:** Functional style often has better borrow ergonomics than loops
4. **Accept necessary allocations:** A temporary Vec of size O(n) is fine; cloning O(n*m) is not

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Cloning weight matrix: O(n*m) time + O(n*m) space
- Temporary result vector: O(n) time + O(n) space ✓
- The temporary Vec allocation is unavoidable since we need to store results somewhere

**When This Matters:**
- Hot paths (called millions of times): forward/backward propagation
- Large data structures: weight matrices, activation maps
- Production code that must scale to larger networks

**When Cloning is OK:**
- Small data structures (< 100 bytes)
- Cold paths (initialization, configuration)
- Developer convenience in non-critical code

### Architecture Patterns

**Trait-Based Design:**
- Activation functions as traits (extensible)
- Future: Loss functions, optimizers, layers as traits
- Enables composition and polymorphism

**Builder Patterns:**
- Network configuration (Phase 5+)
- Training configuration (learning rate, epochs, etc.)
- Makes complex construction ergonomic

**Error Handling:**
- `Result<T, E>` everywhere (no panics in library)
- `thiserror` for ergonomic error types
- Clear error messages with context
- **Never use `unwrap()`** in library code - always propagate errors with `?`

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarking Strategy (Phase 5+)

**Goals:**
- Match or exceed C++ implementation performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Validate optimizations

**Tools:**
- `criterion` crate for statistical benchmarking
- `flamegraph` for profiling
- `perf` for low-level performance analysis

**Metrics to Track:**
- Training throughput (examples/sec)
- Inference latency (ms per prediction)
- Memory usage
- Comparison to C++ baseline

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)

1. **SIMD:** Use `packed_simd` for vectorization
2. **Parallelism:** `rayon` for data parallelism
3. **GPU:** `wgpu` or CUDA for GPU acceleration
4. **Memory:** Pool allocations, minimize copies
5. **Quantization:** Lower precision (f16, int8) where appropriate

## Testing Strategy

### Critical Requirement #1: Negative and Positive Tests for ALL Examples

**⚠️ MANDATORY FOR ALL EXAMPLES:** Every example (Example-1 through Example-N) MUST include both negative and positive tests.

### Critical Requirement #2: README and Visualizations for ALL Examples

**⚠️ MANDATORY FOR ALL EXAMPLES:** Every example (Example-1 through Example-N) MUST include:
1. **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation explaining the example
2. **images/** directory - SVG visualizations showing network state

**Required Structure:**
```
examples/example-N-name/
├── src/main.rs          # Example implementation
├── Cargo.toml           # Package manifest
├── README.md            # ⚠️ MANDATORY - Educational documentation
├── checkpoints/         # Generated by program
│   ├── *_initial.json
│   └── *_trained.json
└── images/              # ⚠️ MANDATORY - SVG visualizations
    ├── *_initial.svg    # Network before training
    └── *_trained.svg    # Network after training
```

**README.md Requirements:**
- Problem description with truth table/dataset
- Network architecture explanation
- Embedded visualizations using relative paths: `![Description](images/file.svg)`
- Detailed observations explaining what to see in each visualization
- Before/after training comparison
- Key learnings section
- References to theory/papers if applicable

**Visualization Requirements:**
- Generated by program using `neural_net_viz` crate
- Initial network state (random weights) - shows baseline
- Trained network state - shows learned patterns
- SVG format (GitHub renders natively in markdown)
- Saved to `images/` directory using `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`

**Example Pattern to Follow:**
See `examples/example-2-backward-propagation-xor/README.md` for complete pattern:
- Comprehensive problem explanation
- Visual comparisons (initial vs trained)
- Detailed observations highlighting key differences
- Educational narrative guiding the reader

**Why This is Mandatory:**

1. **GitHub Experience**: Users can understand examples without running code
2. **Educational Value**: Visual comparisons teach intuition about learning
3. **Documentation**: READMEs serve as searchable, shareable documentation
4. **Accessibility**: Not everyone can/will compile and run the code
5. **Portfolio Quality**: Professional presentation for showcase/hiring

**Enforcement Checklist:**

Before considering any example "complete":
1. Verify `README.md` exists in example directory
2. Verify `images/` directory exists with at least 2 SVG files
3. Verify README embeds visualizations with `![...](images/*.svg)` syntax
4. Verify example program saves checkpoints and generates SVGs
5. Verify visualizations render correctly on GitHub
6. Run example to regenerate images and verify they update

**⚠️ Common Mistakes:**

- ❌ Example-4: Has README.md but NO images/ directory **MUST FIX**
- ❌ Example-5: Has NO README.md and NO images/ directory **MUST FIX**

**DO NOT** consider an example complete without both README and visualizations!

---

### Critical Requirement #1 Details: Negative and Positive Tests

Every example (Example-1 through Example-N) MUST include both negative and positive tests.

**Pattern to Follow:**
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_<task>_untrained_has_high_error() {
        // Negative test: Untrained network should produce high error
        let mut network = FeedForwardNetwork::new(...);

        let inputs = vec![...];
        let targets = vec![...];

        let mean_error = compute_mean_error(&mut network, &inputs, &targets);

        assert!(
            mean_error > 0.3,  // Or appropriate threshold for task
            "Untrained network should have high error (>0.3), but got {:.4}",
            mean_error
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_<task>_network_trains() {
        // Positive test: Trained network should produce low error
        let mut network = FeedForwardNetwork::new(...);

        let inputs = vec![...];
        let targets = vec![...];

        // Train the network
        let iterations = network
            .train_by_error(&inputs, &targets, 0.01, Some(0.1), Some(10000))
            .unwrap();

        assert!(iterations > 0, "Should train for at least 1 iteration");
        assert!(iterations <= 10000, "Should complete within max iterations");

        let mean_error = compute_mean_error(&mut network, &inputs, &targets);

        assert!(
            mean_error < 0.15,  // Or appropriate threshold for task
            "Trained network should have low error (<0.15), but got {:.4}",
            mean_error
        );
    }

    // Optional: Additional tests for specific behaviors
    #[test]
    fn test_<task>_truth_table() {
        // Verify the task's expected behavior
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Why This Pattern is Mandatory:**

1. **Negative Test (Untrained Network):**
   - Verifies the problem is non-trivial
   - Proves random weights don't solve the task by accident
   - Establishes baseline performance
   - Catches bugs where network "cheats" (e.g., always outputs 0)

2. **Positive Test (Trained Network):**
   - Verifies training actually works
   - Ensures backpropagation converges
   - Validates the example is pedagogically sound
   - Prevents regressions in training code

3. **Test Count Expectation:**
   - Minimum: 2 tests (negative + positive)
   - Recommended: 3 tests (negative + positive + specific behavior)
   - Example-1: 5 tests ✓
   - Example-2 (AND, OR, XOR): 3 tests each ✓
   - Example-3 (Complex Boolean): 3 tests each ✓
   - Example-4 (Optimizers): 3 tests ✓
   - Example-5 (Activations): MUST ADD 3 tests ⚠️

**Examples to Follow:**

See `examples/example-2-backward-propagation-xor/src/main.rs` for reference implementation:
- `test_xor_untrained_has_high_error()` - Negative test
- `test_xor_trained_has_low_error()` - Positive test
- `test_xor_truth_table()` - Verification test

**Enforcement:**

Before considering any example "complete":
1. Run `cargo test --package example-N` - must show at least 2-3 tests passing
2. Verify negative test with `grep "untrained.*high_error"` in main.rs
3. Verify positive test with `grep "network_trains\|trained.*low_error"` in main.rs
4. Document test results in example's README

**⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

**Tests:**
- ❌ Example-4: Missing negative test (has 3 comparison tests, but no untrained baseline) **FIXED 2025-10-14**
- ❌ Example-5: Originally created with zero tests **FIXED 2025-10-14**

**README and Visualizations:**
- ❌ Example-4: Has README.md but missing images/ directory **MUST FIX**
- ❌ Example-5: Missing both README.md and images/ directory **MUST FIX**

Always create tests AND documentation DURING or IMMEDIATELY AFTER example implementation, not later.

**Fixes Applied (2025-10-14):**
- Added negative tests to Examples 4 and 5
- All examples now follow the negative+positive test pattern
- Documentation updated to prevent future test omissions

**Still Required:**
- Example-4: Add images/ directory with visualizations
- Example-5: Add README.md and images/ directory with visualizations

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Fast, focused tests
- Run on every code change
- Located in `src/` files with `#[cfg(test)]`

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows (train → test pipeline)
- Validate against known results (XOR, simple datasets)
- Located in `tests/` directory
- Run before commits

### Property-Based Tests (Future)
- `proptest` or `quickcheck` crate
- Test invariants (e.g., backprop gradient matches numerical gradient)
- Find edge cases automatically

### Benchmark Tests
- Performance regression detection
- Compare against baseline
- Track over time

## Documentation Philosophy

**Principle:** Code is read more often than written.

**Standards:**
- Every public API has rustdoc comments
- Include examples in doc comments
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Reference papers/resources for algorithms
- Keep docs in sync with code

**Structure:**
- `docs/` - High-level architecture, plans, learnings
- Rustdoc - API reference and examples
- `examples/` - Working code with tutorials
- `README.md` - Quick start and overview

## Future Directions

### Potential Extensions

1. **Network Architectures:**
   - Multi-layer perceptrons (arbitrary depth)
   - Convolutional neural networks
   - Recurrent neural networks (LSTM, GRU)
   - Transformers
   - Graph neural networks

2. **Training Techniques:**
   - Advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad)
   - Batch normalization
   - Residual connections
   - Attention mechanisms

3. **Applications:**
   - Computer vision (image classification, detection)
   - Natural language processing (text classification, generation)
   - Reinforcement learning (game playing, robotics)
   - Time series forecasting

4. **Tools:**
   - Model visualization
   - Training dashboards
   - Dataset utilities
   - Model export (ONNX)

### Community & Open Source

**When Ready:**
- Publish to crates.io
- Write blog posts about implementation
- Create tutorial series
- Accept contributions
- Build community around educational ML in Rust

## Lessons Learned (To Be Updated)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This section MUST be updated after completing each phase. Future Claude instances will read this BEFORE starting work to avoid repeating mistakes.

### Phase 0: Project Setup

**What Worked Well:**
- Cargo makes dependency management painless
- rustfmt/clippy enforce consistency from day one (caught vec_init_then_push, dead_code)
- thiserror makes error handling ergonomic
- Starting with comprehensive docs pays off
- Using TDD from day one establishes good habits

**Mistakes Made:**
1. **Clippy warnings on first commit:** Used `Vec::with_capacity` + `push` instead of `vec![]` macro
   - **Fix:** Always use `vec![]` when values are known upfront
2. **Dead code warnings:** Had unused `targets` field
   - **Fix:** Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` with comment explaining future use

**Patterns Established:**
- Use `Result<T, NeuralNetError>` everywhere (no panics)
- Trait-based design for extensibility (Activation trait)
- Unidirectional ownership (Network → Layer, no back-pointers)
- Document intention with TODOs and phase markers

**For Future Phases:**
- Always run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before committing
- Use **Rust 2024 idioms** (check clippy suggestions, especially edition-specific lints)
- Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` with explanation for intentionally unused code
- Test edge cases (dimension mismatches, extreme values)
- Watch for `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` warnings (new in 2024 edition)
- Use modern patterns: async closures, let_chains, improved temporaries

### Phase 1: [Skipped - went directly to Phase 2]

### Phase 2: Forward Propagation

**What Worked Well:**
- Workspace structure with `crates/` and `examples/` directories scales well
- Separation of core library from example binaries is clean
- Test-driven development caught matrix dimension bugs early
- Direct C++ → Rust port was straightforward for forward propagation
- `set_weights()` API makes testing deterministic and examples clear
- All 20 tests passing, zero clippy warnings maintained

**Challenges Overcome:**
1. **Workspace configuration:** Learning Cargo workspace features (`workspace.dependencies`, `workspace.package`)
   - **Solution:** Centralized dependency versions in root `Cargo.toml`
   - Makes adding new examples trivial
2. **Public API design:** Initial attempt exposed `weights` field directly
   - **Solution:** Added `set_weights()` method with validation
   - Maintains encapsulation while allowing test/example setup
3. **Doctest failures:** Old crate name `neural_network_rs` in docs
   - **Solution:** Global find/replace to `neural_net_core`
   - Lesson: Update all docs immediately after refactoring

**Implementation Details:**
- **Matrix multiplication:** Implemented from scratch (no external ML libraries per project goals)
  - `inputs[j] = sum(prev_outputs[i] * weights[i][j])` for each neuron j
  - ndarray used only for weight storage, not computation
- **Activation functions:** Trait-based design allows easy extension
  - Linear for input/output layers
  - Sigmoid for hidden layers
- **Error handling:** Dimension validation prevents runtime panics

**Code Quality:**
- Added 5 new tests in `layer.rs` for forward propagation
- Added 3 tests in `examples/forward-propagation/src/main.rs`
- Example demonstrates 3 different inputs through full network
- Documentation updated (README, architecture, learnings)

**For Future Phases:**
- Phase 3 (Backpropagation): Follow same pattern - implement in core lib, demonstrate in example
- Consider adding `examples/03-backpropagation/` for gradient descent visualization
- Matrix operations are currently O(n²) loops - benchmark if performance issues arise
- Keep workspace pattern: each major concept gets its own example directory

### Phase 3: [To be filled in]

### Phase 4: [To be filled in]

### Phase 5: [To be filled in]

### Phase 6: [To be filled in]

## Documentation & Visualization Best Practices

### Educational Files Are Documentation, Not Build Artifacts

**Critical Decision:** Generated visualization and checkpoint files should be committed to git, not ignored.

**Context:** Initial instinct was to add `/checkpoints` and `/images` to `.gitignore` like typical build artifacts.

**Why This Was Wrong:**
- These files are **educational documentation**, not build artifacts
- They're small (checkpoints: ~1-3KB JSON, visualizations: ~2-3KB SVG)
- They demonstrate training progression visually
- Users viewing on GitHub benefit from seeing these without running code
- They're interesting to compare (initial vs trained weights)

**Policy:**
```gitignore
# ✅ CORRECT: Only ignore build artifacts and temp files
/target
/research

# ❌ WRONG: Don't ignore educational outputs
# /checkpoints  # NO - these are documentation!
# /images       # NO - these visualize network state!
```

**Rationale:**
- GitHub renders SVG files natively in README files
- Checkpoint JSON files are readable and educational
- Commit history shows evolution of visualizations
- No practical storage concern (files are tiny)

### SVG Legend Positioning Matters

**Problem Discovered:** Initial visualization placed metadata legend at lower-left (x=10), which obscured the bottom input neuron.

**Why This Happened:**
- Neural networks typically have 2+ input neurons on the left side
- Input neurons are vertically spaced to fill the canvas height
- Legend box (300×120px) at lower-left overlapped with bottom input neuron

**Solution:**
```rust
// ❌ WRONG: Hard-coded lower-left position
writeln!(svg, "<rect x=\"10\" y=\"{}\" ...", config.height - 130)?;
writeln!(svg, "<text x=\"20\" y=\"{}\" ...", base_y)?;

// ✅ CORRECT: Calculate lower-right position
let box_width = 300;
let box_x = config.width - box_width - 10;  // 1200 - 300 - 10 = 890
let text_x = box_x + 10;                     // 900
writeln!(svg, "<rect x=\"{}\" y=\"{}\" width=\"{}\" ...",
    box_x, config.height - 130, box_width)?;
writeln!(svg, "<text x=\"{}\" y=\"{}\" ...", text_x, base_y)?;
```

**Why Lower-Right Works Better:**
- Output layer typically has 1 neuron (or fewer than inputs)
- Less vertical space occupied on right side
- Legend doesn't obscure any network components
- Still visible and readable

**Lesson:** When designing visualizations, consider the typical use case (2-3 inputs → many hidden → 1 output) and position UI elements accordingly.

### File Organization: Use CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR

**Problem:** Using relative paths like `"checkpoints/file.json"` saves to workspace root when running `cargo run -p example-name`.

**Why This Happened:**
- Current working directory when using `cargo run -p` is the workspace root
- Relative paths resolve relative to CWD, not the example's directory
- Results in mixed files from different examples in workspace root (confusing!)

**Solution Pattern:**
```rust
// ❌ WRONG: Relative paths go to workspace root
fs::create_dir_all("checkpoints")?;
network.save_checkpoint("checkpoints/initial.json", metadata)?;

// ✅ CORRECT: Use CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR for example's own directory
let example_dir = env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR");
let checkpoint_dir = format!("{}/checkpoints", example_dir);
let image_dir = format!("{}/images", example_dir);
fs::create_dir_all(&checkpoint_dir)?;
fs::create_dir_all(&image_dir)?;

network.save_checkpoint(
    &format!("{}/initial.json", checkpoint_dir),
    metadata,
)?;
```

**Benefits:**
- Each example has its own `checkpoints/` and `images/` directories
- Clear organization when viewing in file explorer
- No mixing of files from different examples
- Works correctly regardless of CWD

**Pattern to Follow:**
```

├── example-1-forward-propagation/
│   ├── checkpoints/
│   │   ├── xor_initial.json

```

### README Documentation Pattern

**Best Practice:** Each example should have comprehensive documentation visible on GitHub.

**Required Elements:**
1. **Problem statement** with truth table/dataset
2. **Network architecture** explanation (inputs → hidden → outputs)
3. **Embedded visualizations** using relative paths
4. **Detailed observations** explaining what to see in each image
5. **Results table** showing before/after training
6. **Key learnings** section

**Image Embedding Pattern:**
```markdown
### Initial Network (Random Weights)

The network starts with randomly initialized weights:

![XOR Initial Network](images/xor_initial.svg)

**Key observations:**
- **Random weight distribution**: Green (positive) and red (negative) weights scattered throughout
- **No learned pattern**: Line thickness (weight magnitude) shows no meaningful structure
- **Poor performance**: Mean absolute error >1.0, essentially random outputs

### Trained Network

After training with backpropagation:

![XOR Trained Network](images/xor_trained.svg)

**Key observations:**
- **Strong positive weights**: Hidden neurons learn to activate for specific input patterns
- **Balanced output weights**: Some positive (green), some negative (red) for XOR logic
- **Learned representation**: Network has discovered non-linear decision boundary
- **Excellent performance**: Mean absolute error <0.01
```

**Why This Matters:**
- GitHub renders SVG files directly in README
- Users can understand the example without running code
- Visual comparisons teach intuition about learning
- Detailed observations guide what to look for
- Searchable documentation (can grep for concepts)

**Weight Visualization Legend (Include in All READMEs):**
```markdown
**Understanding the visualizations:**
- **Green lines**: Positive weights (increase activation)
- **Red lines**: Negative weights (decrease activation)
- **Line thickness**: Weight magnitude (thicker = stronger influence)
- **Blue neurons**: Input layer
- **Purple neurons**: Hidden layer
- **Orange neurons**: Output layer
```

## Neural Network Animator Tool (2025-10-15)

### What Was Built

**Phase 1 Complete: Backend Infrastructure & CLI**

**✅ Completed Components:**

1. **Animation Script Format** (`src/script.rs`)
   - JSON-based with scenes, annotations, highlights, transitions
   - Supports network metadata, truth tables, test results
   - Scene-based timeline with duration control
   - Annotation system for titles, labels, metrics
   - Highlight system for weight changes, neurons, data flow

2. **Timeline Engine** (`src/timeline.rs`)
   - Playback states: Playing, Paused, Stopped
   - Speed control: 0.25×, 0.5×, 1×, 2×, 4×
   - Seeking: Jump to time, skip to start/end, step forward/back
   - Progress tracking and time formatting
   - Looping support
   - 10 comprehensive tests

3. **Auto-Generation** (`src/generator.rs`)
   - Generates animation scripts from checkpoint files
   - Extracts network architecture automatically
   - Creates scenes with annotations and highlights
   - Configurable scene durations
   - Optional test result integration

4. **CLI Tool** (`src/bin/main.rs`)
   - `generate`: Create animation scripts from checkpoints
   - `validate`: Check script validity and checkpoint existence
   - `serve`: Start web server (placeholder, pending Leptos frontend)
   - Comprehensive clap-based CLI with help text

5. **Test Animation**
   - XOR animation script with 2 scenes (before/after training)
   - Successfully validated and ready for visualization
   - Located at `crates/neural-net-animator/scripts/xor_animation.json`

6. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with CLI usage examples
   - Script format documentation with JSON examples
   - Keyboard shortcuts and control descriptions
   - Workflow examples for creating animations

**Architecture Decisions:**

1. **All-Rust Frontend with Yew**: Chose Yew over Leptos for stability
   - **Why Yew**: Mature, stable API with React-like patterns
   - **Why NOT Leptos**: Breaking changes between versions (0.6 → 0.7 changed core APIs)
   - Domain logic in Rust
   - Presentation logic in Rust
   - JavaScript only for minimal bootstrap/glue
   - Rationale: Educational ML tool needs stable, maintainable patterns

2. **SVG Rendering**: Reuse existing `neural-net-viz` crate
   - Generate SVG server-side from checkpoints
   - Inject into DOM via Yew's `Html::from_html_unchecked()`
   - No need to reimplement visualization logic

3. **Pluggable Scripts**: JSON format allows full control
   - Can be manually edited for fine-tuning
   - Auto-generation provides good defaults
   - Supports complex annotations and highlights

4. **Yew Best Practices Followed**:
   - ✅ Props implement `PartialEq` for efficient re-renders
   - ✅ Use `use_state` for component state
   - ✅ Use `use_effect_with` for side effects
   - ✅ Pass scene indices instead of complex borrowed data
   - ✅ Clone small data (AnimationScript) rather than fighting borrow checker
   - ✅ Use `Callback::from` for event handlers
   - ✅ Proper cleanup with `move || drop(interval)` pattern

### What's Completed (Phase 2: Yew Frontend)

**✅ Yew WASM Implementation Complete - Compiles Successfully**

1. **Yew Components** (all Rust) - `web/src/components/`:
   ```rust
   ✅ App                  // Top-level app component
   ✅ AnimationPlayer      // Main coordinator, loads script
   ✅ NetworkCanvas        // SVG rendering with Html::from_html_unchecked
   ✅ Timeline             // Scrubbing bar with input range
   ✅ DvrControls          // All DVR buttons with callbacks
   ✅ MetricsPanel         // Displays accuracy, error, test results
   ✅ InfoPanel            // Shows network architecture, annotations
   ```

2. **State Management** (Yew Hooks):
   ```rust
   ✅ use_state<AnimationScript>      // Script data
   ✅ use_state<Timeline>             // Timeline controller
   ✅ use_state<Option<String>>       // Current SVG
   ✅ use_effect_with                 // Effects for loading/updating
   ✅ Callback::from                  // Event handlers
   ```

3. **SVG Rendering**:
   ✅ Load checkpoint from server via gloo-net
   ✅ Placeholder SVG generation (TODO: integrate neural-net-viz)
   ✅ Inject into DOM via `Html::from_html_unchecked()`
   ✅ Update on scene changes via interval

4. **Build Setup**:
   ✅ Trunk configuration (`Trunk.toml`)
   ✅ Minimal `index.html` bootstrap
   ✅ Complete CSS styling (`styles.css`)
   ⏳ Needs `cargo install trunk` and `trunk build` (next step)

5. **Server Updates** (`src/server/mod.rs`):
   ✅ Serve Trunk-built dist/ directory
   ✅ Fallback to placeholder if dist doesn't exist
   ✅ Updated checkpoint endpoint for full paths
   ✅ API endpoints: `/api/script`, `/api/checkpoint/*`

### Why This Approach

**Three-Phase Strategy:**

**Phase 1** (Completed):
- Build solid foundation with data structures
- Implement timeline logic and CLI
- Create test animations
- Document usage patterns
- **Result**: Fully functional backend and CLI tool

**Phase 2** (Completed):
- Initially tried Leptos but hit breaking API changes
- **Pivoted to Yew** - more stable, mature framework
- Implemented all components following Yew best practices
- **Result**: Compiling Yew frontend with proper Rust patterns

**Phase 3** (Next):
- Install Trunk: `cargo install trunk`
- Build: `cd web && trunk build`
- Test in browser with full integration
- **Benefit**: Clean implementation without workarounds

### Usage (Current)

**Generate Animation:**
```bash
./target/release/neural-net-animator generate \
  --output xor_animation.json \
  --title "XOR Learning" \
  checkpoints/xor_initial.json \
  checkpoints/xor_trained.json
```

**Validate Animation:**
```bash
./target/release/neural-net-animator validate xor_animation.json
```

**Serve (Pending Frontend):**
```bash
# Will work after Leptos implementation
./target/release/neural-net-animator serve xor_animation.json
```

### Key Lessons

1. **Choose Stable Frameworks**: Yew's stability > Leptos' novelty
   - Leptos 0.6 → 0.7 broke Signal API, wasm_bindgen imports, string rendering
   - Yew has consistent API since 0.18, well-documented patterns
   - **Lesson**: For educational tools, prioritize stability and clear docs

2. **Follow Framework Patterns, Don't Fight Them**:
   - ✅ **Correct**: Pass scene index `scene_idx: Option<usize>` in props
   - ❌ **Wrong**: Pass full scene tuple `scene: Option<(usize, Scene, f64)>` (Yew can't derive PartialEq)
   - ✅ **Correct**: Clone small data (`AnimationScript`) when needed
   - ❌ **Wrong**: Complex borrowing gymnastics to avoid clones
   - **Lesson**: Framework ergonomics exist for a reason - use them

3. **Implement PartialEq Correctly**:
   - Timeline needed PartialEq but contains `Instant` (doesn't implement PartialEq)
   - ✅ **Solution**: Manual impl comparing all fields except `last_update`
   - ✅ **Clean**: Use epsilon comparison for f64 fields (`abs() < 0.001`)
   - ❌ **Avoid**: Skipping PartialEq and working around it everywhere

4. **Add Derives Early**: PartialEq requirements cascade
   - AnimationScript needs PartialEq → all nested types need it too
   - Added to 15+ types: Scene, NetworkState, Annotation, Highlight, etc.
   - **Lesson**: Add common derives (Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize) upfront

5. **Architecture First**: Built solid data structures before rushing to UI
   - Timeline has 10 tests, all passing
   - Clean separation: Backend logic independent of frontend choice
   - CLI first: Tool immediately useful without web UI

6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README makes tool approachable
   - Documented script format, CLI usage, keyboard shortcuts
   - Examples of workflows and troubleshooting

7. **Avoid Unmaintainable Workarounds**:
   - When Leptos proved problematic, we pivoted rather than hack around it
   - Better to restart with stable foundation than build on shaky ground
   - **Lesson**: Technical debt compounds - choose clean solutions

### Next Steps (Phase 3: Build & Test)

1. ✅ **Yew project created** in `web/` directory
2. ✅ **All components implemented** (7 components, all compile)
3. ✅ **State management wired** with Yew hooks
4. ⏳ **Install Trunk**: `cargo install trunk`
5. ⏳ **Build with Trunk**: `cd web && trunk build`
6. ⏳ **Test in browser**: Start server, open http://localhost:8080
7. ⏳ **Integrate neural-net-viz**: Replace placeholder SVG with real rendering
8. ⏳ **End-to-end test**: Validate with Playwright

**Remaining Effort**: ~10-20k tokens (build, test, fix integration issues)

### Yew Best Practices Reference

**For Future Yew Development:**

1. **Props Must Implement PartialEq**:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Properties, PartialEq)]  // PartialEq is required
   pub struct MyProps {
       pub data: SomeType,  // SomeType must also impl PartialEq
   }
   ```

2. **State Management**:
   ```rust
   let state = use_state(|| initial_value);
   state.set(new_value);   // Update state
   let value = (*state).clone();  // Read state (dereference, then clone)
   ```

3. **Effects**:
   ```rust
   use_effect_with((), move |_| {
       // Run on mount
       || () // Cleanup function
   });
   ```

4. **Event Handlers**:
   ```rust
   let onclick = Callback::from(move |_| {
       // Handle event
   });
   ```

5. **Complex Props - Pass Indices, Not References**:
   ```rust
   // ✅ GOOD: Pass simple data
   pub scene_idx: Option<usize>

   // ❌ BAD: Pass complex borrowed data
   pub scene: Option<(usize, &Scene, f64)>
   ```

6. **HTML Injection** (for SVG):
   ```rust
   Html::from_html_unchecked(AttrValue::from(svg_string))
   ```
