# Project Learnings & Decisions

This document captures key decisions, lessons learned, and development practices for the neural network project.

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD / Red-Green-Refactor)

**Decision:** We are using a Test-Driven Development approach for all feature implementation.

**Process:**
1. **Red:** Write a failing test first that defines desired behavior
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor:** Improve code quality while keeping tests green

**Benefits:**
- Clear specification of behavior before implementation
- High test coverage by design
- Confidence when refactoring
- Better API design (tests expose awkward interfaces)
- Documentation through examples

**Example from Phase 0:**
- Wrote tests for activation functions first (sigmoid, linear)
- Implemented functions to pass tests
- Added edge case tests (extreme values)
- Refactored for performance (inline, const)

**Going Forward:**
- Phase 2 (Forward Propagation): Write tests with known input/output pairs, then implement
- Phase 3 (Backpropagation): Test gradient calculations against numerical gradients
- All new features require tests before implementation

### Continuous Integration Strategy

**Decision:** Use local CI infrastructure instead of GitHub Actions.

**Rationale:**
- GitHub Actions runs on GitHub's cloud servers (not local)
- Free tier limits: 2000 minutes/month for private repos
- Potential costs if free tier exceeded
- Project owner has dedicated local servers for CI
- Local CI provides:
  - No external service dependencies
  - Full control over build environment
  - No quota concerns
  - Faster feedback (no queue wait times)
  - Privacy for proprietary work

**Local CI Commands:**
```bash
# These can be automated in your local CI system
cargo test                      # Run all tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings     # Lint with strict warnings
cargo fmt -- --check            # Verify formatting
cargo doc --no-deps             # Build documentation
cargo bench                     # Run benchmarks (Phase 5+)
```

**Alternative CI Solutions (if needed):**
- Jenkins (self-hosted)
- GitLab CI (self-hosted)
- Drone CI (self-hosted)
- Buildkite (hybrid)

## Project Scope Evolution

## Technical Decisions

### Rust Edition and Code Style

**Decision:** Use Rust 2021 edition with modern idioms.

**Requirements:**
- **Edition:** 2021 (latest stable) specified in `Cargo.toml`
- **Zero clippy warnings:** Enforced in local CI with `-D warnings` flag
- **Modern patterns:** Follow Rust 2021 idioms and best practices

**Key Patterns to Follow:**
```rust
// ✅ CORRECT: Use vec![] macro (clippy: vec_init_then_push)
let layers = vec![
    Layer::new(0, input_size, None),
    Layer::new(1, hidden_size, Some(input_size)),
    Layer::new(2, output_size, Some(hidden_size)),
];

// ❌ INCORRECT: Don't use push pattern when vec![] is clearer
let mut layers = Vec::with_capacity(3);
layers.push(Layer::new(0, input_size, None));
layers.push(Layer::new(1, hidden_size, Some(input_size)));
// ...

// ✅ CORRECT: Mark intentionally unused fields with #[allow]
#[allow(dead_code)]
targets: Option<Vec<f32>>,  // Will be used in Phase 3

// ✅ CORRECT: Use ? operator for error propagation
let data = self.load_data()?;

// ✅ CORRECT: Use inline for hot path functions
#[inline]
fn activate(&self, x: f32) -> f32 { ... }
```

**Common Clippy Warnings to Watch:**
- `dead_code` - Mark unused code with `#[allow(dead_code)]` if intentional (with comment explaining why)
- `vec_init_then_push` - Use `vec![]` macro instead of push pattern
- `needless_pass_by_value` - Use `&self` when appropriate
- `unnecessary_wraps` - Don't wrap Result if never fails
- `missing_docs` - Document all public APIs
- `large_enum_variant` - Box large enum variants

**Why This Matters:**
- Clippy catches common mistakes and anti-patterns
- Edition 2021 provides latest language improvements
- Consistent style improves maintainability
- Following idioms makes code more familiar to Rust developers

### Why Rust?

**Advantages:**
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions (as fast as C++)
- Excellent type system (catch bugs at compile time)
- Modern tooling (Cargo, rustfmt, clippy)
- Growing ML/scientific computing ecosystem
- Fearless concurrency (future parallelization)

**Challenges:**
- Borrow checker learning curve
- Fewer ML libraries than Python
- More verbose than Python for prototyping

**Verdict:** Worth it for production-quality, high-performance ML code.

### Why ndarray?

**Decision:** Use `ndarray` crate for multi-dimensional arrays.

**Rationale:**
- Most mature Rust array library
- Similar API to NumPy (familiar)
- BLAS/LAPACK integration (fast linear algebra)
- Memory layout control (row-major, column-major)
- Good interop with other crates
- Active maintenance

**Alternatives Considered:**
- `nalgebra` - More focused on linear algebra, less ML-oriented
- Manual `Vec<Vec<f32>>` - Poor cache locality, no BLAS

### Architecture Patterns

**Trait-Based Design:**
- Activation functions as traits (extensible)
- Future: Loss functions, optimizers, layers as traits
- Enables composition and polymorphism

**Builder Patterns:**
- Network configuration (Phase 5+)
- Training configuration (learning rate, epochs, etc.)
- Makes complex construction ergonomic

**Error Handling:**
- `Result<T, E>` everywhere (no panics in library)
- `thiserror` for ergonomic error types
- Clear error messages with context

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarking Strategy (Phase 5+)

**Goals:**
- Match or exceed C++ implementation performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Validate optimizations

**Tools:**
- `criterion` crate for statistical benchmarking
- `flamegraph` for profiling
- `perf` for low-level performance analysis

**Metrics to Track:**
- Training throughput (examples/sec)
- Inference latency (ms per prediction)
- Memory usage
- Comparison to C++ baseline

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)

1. **SIMD:** Use `packed_simd` for vectorization
2. **Parallelism:** `rayon` for data parallelism
3. **GPU:** `wgpu` or CUDA for GPU acceleration
4. **Memory:** Pool allocations, minimize copies
5. **Quantization:** Lower precision (f16, int8) where appropriate

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Fast, focused tests
- Run on every code change
- Located in `src/` files with `#[cfg(test)]`

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows (train → test pipeline)
- Validate against known results (XOR, simple datasets)
- Located in `tests/` directory
- Run before commits

### Property-Based Tests (Future)
- `proptest` or `quickcheck` crate
- Test invariants (e.g., backprop gradient matches numerical gradient)
- Find edge cases automatically

### Benchmark Tests
- Performance regression detection
- Compare against baseline
- Track over time

## Documentation Philosophy

**Principle:** Code is read more often than written.

**Standards:**
- Every public API has rustdoc comments
- Include examples in doc comments
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Reference papers/resources for algorithms
- Keep docs in sync with code

**Structure:**
- `docs/` - High-level architecture, plans, learnings
- Rustdoc - API reference and examples
- `examples/` - Working code with tutorials
- `README.md` - Quick start and overview

## Future Directions

### Potential Extensions

1. **Network Architectures:**
   - Multi-layer perceptrons (arbitrary depth)
   - Convolutional neural networks
   - Recurrent neural networks (LSTM, GRU)
   - Transformers
   - Graph neural networks

2. **Training Techniques:**
   - Advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad)
   - Batch normalization
   - Residual connections
   - Attention mechanisms

3. **Applications:**
   - Computer vision (image classification, detection)
   - Natural language processing (text classification, generation)
   - Reinforcement learning (game playing, robotics)
   - Time series forecasting

4. **Tools:**
   - Model visualization
   - Training dashboards
   - Dataset utilities
   - Model export (ONNX)

### Community & Open Source

**When Ready:**
- Publish to crates.io
- Write blog posts about implementation
- Create tutorial series
- Accept contributions
- Build community around educational ML in Rust

## Lessons Learned (To Be Updated)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This section MUST be updated after completing each phase. Future Claude instances will read this BEFORE starting work to avoid repeating mistakes.

### Phase 0: Project Setup

**What Worked Well:**
- Cargo makes dependency management painless
- rustfmt/clippy enforce consistency from day one (caught vec_init_then_push, dead_code)
- thiserror makes error handling ergonomic
- Starting with comprehensive docs pays off
- Using TDD from day one establishes good habits

**Mistakes Made:**
1. **Clippy warnings on first commit:** Used `Vec::with_capacity` + `push` instead of `vec![]` macro
   - **Fix:** Always use `vec![]` when values are known upfront
2. **Dead code warnings:** Had unused `targets` field
   - **Fix:** Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` with comment explaining future use

**Patterns Established:**
- Use `Result<T, NeuralNetError>` everywhere (no panics)
- Trait-based design for extensibility (Activation trait)
- Unidirectional ownership (Network → Layer, no back-pointers)
- Document intention with TODOs and phase markers

**For Future Phases:**
- Always run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before committing
- Use Rust 2021 idioms (check clippy suggestions)
- Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` with explanation for intentionally unused code
- Test edge cases (dimension mismatches, extreme values)
