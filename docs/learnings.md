# Project Learnings & Decisions

This document captures key decisions, lessons learned, and development practices for the neural network project.

## Core Principles

### Architecture Over Features

**Priority:** Clean, maintainable architecture comes before feature velocity.

**Philosophy:**
- **Small, focused crates:** Each crate should have a single, clear responsibility
- **Short, documented functions:** Functions should be concise, well-named, and thoroughly documented
- **Comprehensive testing:** Every function should have tests that validate behavior
- **Examples are secondary:** Core library quality takes precedence over example code

**Rationale:**
- **Maintainability:** Smaller modules are easier to understand and modify
- **Testability:** Short functions with clear inputs/outputs are easier to test
- **Onboarding:** New contributors can understand the codebase faster
- **Long-term velocity:** Technical debt slows development over time
- **Teaching:** Clean code teaches better patterns to learners

**Guidelines:**
1. **Crate Size:** A crate should contain related modules, not become a monolith
   - If a crate has >10 modules, consider splitting
   - Each crate should have a clear, single-sentence purpose
2. **Function Length:** Aim for <50 lines per function
   - Extract complex logic into helper functions
   - Use descriptive names that explain intent
3. **Documentation:** Every public item needs docs
   - Explain "why" not just "what"
   - Include examples for non-trivial APIs
4. **Testing:** Test coverage should be comprehensive
   - Unit tests for individual functions
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Edge cases and error conditions

**Decision Making:**
When choosing between "ship feature fast" vs "improve architecture":
- **Choose architecture** if the change affects core abstractions
- **Choose architecture** if technical debt will compound
- **Choose architecture** if it improves clarity for learners
- **Ship feature** only if architecture is already sound

**Example - Types Crate Refactor:**
Current state: neural-net-core contains both data structures AND algorithms
Better state: neural-net-types (data structures) + neural-net-core (algorithms)
Decision: Pause features, refactor architecture first ✓

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD / Red-Green-Refactor)

**Decision:** We are using a Test-Driven Development approach for all feature implementation.

**Process:**
1. **Red:** Write a failing test first that defines desired behavior
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor:** Improve code quality while keeping tests green

**Benefits:**
- Clear specification of behavior before implementation
- High test coverage by design
- Confidence when refactoring
- Better API design (tests expose awkward interfaces)
- Documentation through examples

**Example from Phase 0:**
- Wrote tests for activation functions first (sigmoid, linear)
- Implemented functions to pass tests
- Added edge case tests (extreme values)
- Refactored for performance (inline, const)

**Going Forward:**
- Phase 2 (Forward Propagation): Write tests with known input/output pairs, then implement
- Phase 3 (Backpropagation): Test gradient calculations against numerical gradients
- All new features require tests before implementation

### Continuous Integration Strategy

**Decision:** Use local CI infrastructure instead of GitHub Actions.

**Rationale:**
- GitHub Actions runs on GitHub's cloud servers (not local)
- Free tier limits: 2000 minutes/month for private repos
- Potential costs if free tier exceeded
- Project owner has dedicated local servers for CI
- Local CI provides:
  - No external service dependencies
  - Full control over build environment
  - No quota concerns
  - Faster feedback (no queue wait times)
  - Privacy for proprietary work

**Local CI Commands:**
```bash
# These can be automated in your local CI system
cargo test                      # Run all tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings     # Lint with strict warnings
cargo fmt -- --check            # Verify formatting
cargo doc --no-deps             # Build documentation
cargo bench                     # Run benchmarks (Phase 5+)
```

**Alternative CI Solutions (if needed):**
- Jenkins (self-hosted)
- GitLab CI (self-hosted)
- Drone CI (self-hosted)
- Buildkite (hybrid)

## Technical Decisions

### Rust Edition and Code Style

**Decision:** Use Rust 2024 edition with latest modern idioms.

**Requirements:**
- **Edition:** 2024 (released Feb 2025 with Rust 1.85.0) specified in `Cargo.toml`
- **Zero clippy warnings:** Enforced in local CI with `-D warnings` flag
- **Modern patterns:** Follow Rust 2024 idioms and best practices

**Rust 2024 Edition Key Features:**
- **unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn:** Enabled by default - constrains unsafe actions to smallest scope
- **Async closures:** `async || {}` syntax for native async concurrency
- **Reserved `gen` keyword:** For future async generator support
- **Improved temporary handling:** Better lifetime management for temporary variables
- **Enhanced match patterns:** More ergonomic pattern matching
- **Unsafe block improvements:** Clearer unsafe boundaries
- **Cargo rust-version aware:** Better dependency resolution

**Key Patterns to Follow:**
```rust
// ✅ CORRECT: Use vec![] macro (clippy: vec_init_then_push)
let layers = vec![
    Layer::new(0, input_size, None),
    Layer::new(1, hidden_size, Some(input_size)),
    Layer::new(2, output_size, Some(hidden_size)),
];

// ❌ INCORRECT: Don't use push pattern when vec![] is clearer
let mut layers = Vec::with_capacity(3);
layers.push(Layer::new(0, input_size, None));
layers.push(Layer::new(1, hidden_size, Some(input_size)));
// ...

// ✅ CORRECT: Mark intentionally unused fields with #[allow]
#[allow(dead_code)]
targets: Option<Vec<f32>>,  // Will be used in Phase 3

// ✅ CORRECT: Use ? operator for error propagation
let data = self.load_data()?;

// ✅ CORRECT: Use inline for hot path functions
#[inline]
fn activate(&self, x: f32) -> f32 { ... }
```

**Common Clippy Warnings to Watch:**
- `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` - **Rust 2024 default:** Use nested `unsafe {}` blocks within unsafe functions
- `dead_code` - Mark unused code with `#[allow(dead_code)]` if intentional (with comment explaining why)
- `vec_init_then_push` - Use `vec![]` macro instead of push pattern
- `collapsible_if` with let_chains - **Edition 2024 gated:** Use let_chains for cleaner conditionals
- `needless_pass_by_value` - Use `&self` when appropriate
- `unnecessary_wraps` - Don't wrap Result if never fails
- `missing_docs` - Document all public APIs
- `large_enum_variant` - Box large enum variants

**Why This Matters:**
- Clippy catches common mistakes and anti-patterns
- **Edition 2024** provides latest language improvements (async closures, improved safety)
- Consistent style improves maintainability
- Following idioms makes code more familiar to Rust developers
- **Rust 2024 specifically** improves safety boundaries and async ergonomics

### Why Rust?

**Advantages:**
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions (as fast as C++)
- Excellent type system (catch bugs at compile time)
- Modern tooling (Cargo, rustfmt, clippy)
- Growing ML/scientific computing ecosystem
- Fearless concurrency (future parallelization)

**Challenges:**
- Borrow checker learning curve
- Fewer ML libraries than Python
- More verbose than Python for prototyping

**Verdict:** Worth it for production-quality, high-performance ML code.

### Why ndarray?

**Decision:** Use `ndarray` crate for multi-dimensional arrays.

**Rationale:**
- Most mature Rust array library
- Similar API to NumPy (familiar)
- BLAS/LAPACK integration (fast linear algebra)
- Memory layout control (row-major, column-major)
- Good interop with other crates
- Active maintenance

**Alternatives Considered:**
- `nalgebra` - More focused on linear algebra, less ML-oriented
- Manual `Vec<Vec<f32>>` - Poor cache locality, no BLAS

### Rust Borrowing Patterns for Performance

**Critical Principle:** Avoid cloning large data structures in performance-critical paths.

**Problem:** When working with mutable and immutable borrows simultaneously, the naive solution is to clone data to satisfy the borrow checker. However, cloning large arrays (like weight matrices) on every forward pass is O(n*m) and doesn't scale.

**Solution Pattern - Compute Then Write:**
```rust
// ❌ INCORRECT: Cloning large arrays
let weights_clone = weights.clone(); // O(n*m) - too expensive!
let inputs = layer.inputs_mut();
for col in 0..num_neurons {
    for row in 0..num_prev {
        sum += prev_outputs[row] * weights_clone[[row, col]];
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Compute in scope, then write
let new_inputs: Vec<f32> = {
    let weights = layer.weights()?; // Immutable borrow
    (0..num_neurons)
        .map(|col| {
            (0..num_prev)
                .map(|row| prev_outputs[row] * weights[[row, col]])
                .sum()
        })
        .collect()
}; // Borrow ends here - only O(n) temporary allocation
*layer.inputs_mut() = new_inputs; // Single mutable borrow
```

**Key Techniques:**
1. **Scope borrows:** Use `{ }` blocks to end borrows before taking new ones
2. **Compute-then-write:** Calculate all results with immutable borrows, then write with one mutable borrow
3. **Iterator chains:** Functional style often has better borrow ergonomics than loops
4. **Accept necessary allocations:** A temporary Vec of size O(n) is fine; cloning O(n*m) is not

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Cloning weight matrix: O(n*m) time + O(n*m) space
- Temporary result vector: O(n) time + O(n) space ✓
- The temporary Vec allocation is unavoidable since we need to store results somewhere

**When This Matters:**
- Hot paths (called millions of times): forward/backward propagation
- Large data structures: weight matrices, activation maps
- Production code that must scale to larger networks

**When Cloning is OK:**
- Small data structures (< 100 bytes)
- Cold paths (initialization, configuration)
- Developer convenience in non-critical code

### Architecture Patterns

**Trait-Based Design:**
- Activation functions as traits (extensible)
- Future: Loss functions, optimizers, layers as traits
- Enables composition and polymorphism

**Builder Patterns:**
- Network configuration (Phase 5+)
- Training configuration (learning rate, epochs, etc.)
- Makes complex construction ergonomic

**Error Handling:**
- `Result<T, E>` everywhere (no panics in library)
- `thiserror` for ergonomic error types
- Clear error messages with context
- **Never use `unwrap()`** in library code - always propagate errors with `?`

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarking Strategy (Phase 5+)

**Goals:**
- Match or exceed C++ implementation performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Validate optimizations

**Tools:**
- `criterion` crate for statistical benchmarking
- `flamegraph` for profiling
- `perf` for low-level performance analysis

**Metrics to Track:**
- Training throughput (examples/sec)
- Inference latency (ms per prediction)
- Memory usage
- Comparison to C++ baseline

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)

1. **SIMD:** Use `packed_simd` for vectorization
2. **Parallelism:** `rayon` for data parallelism
3. **GPU:** `wgpu` or CUDA for GPU acceleration
4. **Memory:** Pool allocations, minimize copies
5. **Quantization:** Lower precision (f16, int8) where appropriate

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Fast, focused tests
- Run on every code change
- Located in `src/` files with `#[cfg(test)]`

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows (train → test pipeline)
- Validate against known results (XOR, simple datasets)
- Located in `tests/` directory
- Run before commits

### Property-Based Tests (Future)
- `proptest` or `quickcheck` crate
- Test invariants (e.g., backprop gradient matches numerical gradient)
- Find edge cases automatically

### Benchmark Tests
- Performance regression detection
- Compare against baseline
- Track over time

## Documentation Philosophy

**Principle:** Code is read more often than written.

**Standards:**
- Every public API has rustdoc comments
- Include examples in doc comments
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Reference papers/resources for algorithms
- Keep docs in sync with code

**Structure:**
- `docs/` - High-level architecture, plans, learnings
- Rustdoc - API reference and examples
- `examples/` - Working code with tutorials

## Lessons Learned (To Be Updated)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This section MUST be updated after completing each phase. Future Claude instances will read this BEFORE starting work to avoid repeating mistakes.

### Phase 0: Project Setup

**What Worked Well:**
- Cargo makes dependency management painless
- rustfmt/clippy enforce consistency from day one (caught vec_init_then_push, dead_code)
- thiserror makes error handling ergonomic
- Starting with comprehensive docs pays off
- Using TDD from day one establishes good habits

**Mistakes Made:**
1. **Clippy warnings on first commit:** Used `Vec::with_capacity` + `push` instead of `vec![]` macro
   - **Fix:** Always use `vec![]` when values are known upfront
2. **Dead code warnings:** Had unused `targets` field
   - **Fix:** Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` with comment explaining future use

**Patterns Established:**
- Use `Result<T, NeuralNetError>` everywhere (no panics)
- Trait-based design for extensibility (Activation trait)
- Unidirectional ownership (Network → Layer, no back-pointers)
- Document intention with TODOs and phase markers

**For Future Phases:**
- Always run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before committing
- Use **Rust 2024 idioms** (check clippy suggestions, especially edition-specific lints)
- Add `#[allow(dead_code)]` with explanation for intentionally unused code
- Test edge cases (dimension mismatches, extreme values)
- Watch for `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` warnings (new in 2024 edition)
- Use modern patterns: async closures, let_chains, improved temporaries

### Phase 1: [Skipped - went directly to Phase 2]

### Phase 2: Forward Propagation

**What Worked Well:**
- Workspace structure with `crates/` and `examples/` directories scales well
- Separation of core library from example binaries is clean
- Test-driven development caught matrix dimension bugs early
- Direct C++ → Rust port was straightforward for forward propagation
- `set_weights()` API makes testing deterministic and examples clear
- All 20 tests passing, zero clippy warnings maintained

**Challenges Overcome:**
1. **Workspace configuration:** Learning Cargo workspace features (`workspace.dependencies`, `workspace.package`)
   - **Solution:** Centralized dependency versions in root `Cargo.toml`
   - Makes adding new examples trivial
2. **Public API design:** Initial attempt exposed `weights` field directly
   - **Solution:** Added `set_weights()` method with validation
   - Maintains encapsulation while allowing test/example setup
3. **Doctest failures:** Old crate name `neural_network_rs` in docs
   - **Solution:** Global find/replace to `neural_net_core`
   - Lesson: Update all docs immediately after refactoring

**Implementation Details:**
- **Matrix multiplication:** Implemented from scratch (no external ML libraries per project goals)
  - `inputs[j] = sum(prev_outputs[i] * weights[i][j])` for each neuron j
  - ndarray used only for weight storage, not computation
- **Activation functions:** Trait-based design allows easy extension
  - Linear for input/output layers
  - Sigmoid for hidden layers
- **Error handling:** Dimension validation prevents runtime panics

**Code Quality:**
- Added 5 new tests in `layer.rs` for forward propagation
- Added 3 tests in `examples/forward-propagation/src/main.rs`
- Example demonstrates 3 different inputs through full network
- Documentation updated (README, architecture, learnings)

**For Future Phases:**
- Phase 3 (Backpropagation): Follow same pattern - implement in core lib, demonstrate in example
- Consider adding `examples/03-backpropagation/` for gradient descent visualization
- Matrix operations are currently O(n²) loops - benchmark if performance issues arise
- Keep workspace pattern: each major concept gets its own example directory

### Phase 3: [To be filled in]

### Phase 4: [To be filled in]

### Phase 5: [To be filled in]

### Phase 6: [To be filled in]

**Last Updated:** Phase 2 completion (2025-10-14)
**Next Update:** After completing Phase 3 (Backpropagation), add lessons learned
