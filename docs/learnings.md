# Project Learnings & Decisions

This document captures key decisions, lessons learned, and development practices for the neural network project.

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD / Red-Green-Refactor)

**Decision:** We are using a Test-Driven Development approach for all feature implementation.

**Process:**
1. **Red:** Write a failing test first that defines desired behavior
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor:** Improve code quality while keeping tests green

**Benefits:**
- Clear specification of behavior before implementation
- High test coverage by design
- Confidence when refactoring
- Better API design (tests expose awkward interfaces)
- Documentation through examples

**Example from Phase 0:**
- Wrote tests for activation functions first (sigmoid, linear)
- Implemented functions to pass tests
- Added edge case tests (extreme values)
- Refactored for performance (inline, const)

**Going Forward:**
- Phase 2 (Forward Propagation): Write tests with known input/output pairs, then implement
- Phase 3 (Backpropagation): Test gradient calculations against numerical gradients
- All new features require tests before implementation

### Continuous Integration Strategy

**Decision:** Use local CI infrastructure instead of GitHub Actions.

**Rationale:**
- GitHub Actions runs on GitHub's cloud servers (not local)
- Free tier limits: 2000 minutes/month for private repos
- Potential costs if free tier exceeded
- Project owner has dedicated local servers for CI
- Local CI provides:
  - No external service dependencies
  - Full control over build environment
  - No quota concerns
  - Faster feedback (no queue wait times)
  - Privacy for proprietary work

**Local CI Commands:**
```bash
# These can be automated in your local CI system
cargo test                      # Run all tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings     # Lint with strict warnings
cargo fmt -- --check            # Verify formatting
cargo doc --no-deps             # Build documentation
cargo bench                     # Run benchmarks (Phase 5+)
```

**Alternative CI Solutions (if needed):**
- Jenkins (self-hosted)
- GitLab CI (self-hosted)
- Drone CI (self-hosted)
- Buildkite (hybrid)

## Project Scope Evolution

### From Simple Port to ML Demonstration Platform

**Original Goal:** Port C++ feed-forward neural network to Rust

**Evolved Goal:** Create a comprehensive neural network and machine learning demonstration platform

**Vision:**
1. **Core Library (`neural-network-rs`):**
   - Reusable data structures (Tensor, Layer, Network, etc.)
   - Generic algorithms (gradient descent, backprop, optimizers)
   - Modular activation functions
   - Extensible architecture for new network types
   - High performance, zero-cost abstractions
   - Well-documented APIs

2. **Example Directories (Incremental Learning):**
   - `examples/01-feedforward/` - Basic FFN (current Phase 0-4 work)
     - XOR learning
     - Digit recognition
     - Visualization of decision boundaries
   - `examples/02-optimizers/` - Advanced training (future)
     - SGD with momentum
     - Adam optimizer
     - Learning rate schedules
   - `examples/03-regularization/` - Overfitting prevention (future)
     - L1/L2 regularization
     - Dropout
     - Early stopping
   - `examples/04-cnn/` - Convolutional networks (future)
     - Image classification
     - Feature visualization

     - Image generation
     - Style transfer
   - And more...

3. **Tutorials & Visualizations:**
   - Each example directory includes:
     - README with theory/concepts
     - Working code with extensive comments
     - Visualization of results (plots, animations)
     - Performance benchmarks
     - References to papers/resources

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- Incremental learning path for users
- Reusable core library across examples
- Each example can be understood independently
- Clear progression from simple to complex
- Easy to add new techniques over time
- Great portfolio/educational resource

## Technical Decisions

### Why Rust?

**Advantages:**
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions (as fast as C++)
- Excellent type system (catch bugs at compile time)
- Modern tooling (Cargo, rustfmt, clippy)
- Growing ML/scientific computing ecosystem
- Fearless concurrency (future parallelization)

**Challenges:**
- Borrow checker learning curve
- Fewer ML libraries than Python
- More verbose than Python for prototyping

**Verdict:** Worth it for production-quality, high-performance ML code.

### Why ndarray?

**Decision:** Use `ndarray` crate for multi-dimensional arrays.

**Rationale:**
- Most mature Rust array library
- Similar API to NumPy (familiar)
- BLAS/LAPACK integration (fast linear algebra)
- Memory layout control (row-major, column-major)
- Good interop with other crates
- Active maintenance

**Alternatives Considered:**
- `nalgebra` - More focused on linear algebra, less ML-oriented
- Manual `Vec<Vec<f32>>` - Poor cache locality, no BLAS

### Architecture Patterns

**Trait-Based Design:**
- Activation functions as traits (extensible)
- Future: Loss functions, optimizers, layers as traits
- Enables composition and polymorphism

**Builder Patterns:**
- Network configuration (Phase 5+)
- Training configuration (learning rate, epochs, etc.)
- Makes complex construction ergonomic

**Error Handling:**
- `Result<T, E>` everywhere (no panics in library)
- `thiserror` for ergonomic error types
- Clear error messages with context

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarking Strategy (Phase 5+)

**Goals:**
- Match or exceed C++ implementation performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Validate optimizations

**Tools:**
- `criterion` crate for statistical benchmarking
- `flamegraph` for profiling
- `perf` for low-level performance analysis

**Metrics to Track:**
- Training throughput (examples/sec)
- Inference latency (ms per prediction)
- Memory usage
- Comparison to C++ baseline

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)

1. **SIMD:** Use `packed_simd` for vectorization
2. **Parallelism:** `rayon` for data parallelism
3. **GPU:** `wgpu` or CUDA for GPU acceleration
4. **Memory:** Pool allocations, minimize copies
5. **Quantization:** Lower precision (f16, int8) where appropriate

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Fast, focused tests
- Run on every code change
- Located in `src/` files with `#[cfg(test)]`

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows (train â†’ test pipeline)
- Validate against known results (XOR, simple datasets)
- Located in `tests/` directory
- Run before commits

### Property-Based Tests (Future)
- `proptest` or `quickcheck` crate
- Test invariants (e.g., backprop gradient matches numerical gradient)
- Find edge cases automatically

### Benchmark Tests
- Performance regression detection
- Compare against baseline
- Track over time

## Documentation Philosophy

**Principle:** Code is read more often than written.

**Standards:**
- Every public API has rustdoc comments
- Include examples in doc comments
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Reference papers/resources for algorithms
- Keep docs in sync with code

**Structure:**
- `docs/` - High-level architecture, plans, learnings
- Rustdoc - API reference and examples
- `examples/` - Working code with tutorials
- `README.md` - Quick start and overview

## Future Directions

### Potential Extensions

1. **Network Architectures:**
   - Multi-layer perceptrons (arbitrary depth)
   - Convolutional neural networks
   - Recurrent neural networks (LSTM, GRU)
   - Transformers
   - Graph neural networks

2. **Training Techniques:**
   - Advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad)
   - Batch normalization
   - Residual connections
   - Attention mechanisms

3. **Applications:**
   - Computer vision (image classification, detection)
   - Natural language processing (text classification, generation)
   - Reinforcement learning (game playing, robotics)
   - Time series forecasting

4. **Tools:**
   - Model visualization
   - Training dashboards
   - Dataset utilities
