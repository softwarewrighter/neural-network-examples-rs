//! Neural Network Examples in Rust
//!
//! This is a workspace root package that provides quality assurance tests
//! for the entire repository.
//!
//! The actual neural network implementations are in the workspace member crates:
//! - `neural-net-core` - Core neural network library
//! - `neural-net-viz` - Visualization library
//! - `neural-net-animator` - Animation tools
//!
//! See the examples/ directory for demonstrations of neural network concepts.

// This is intentionally minimal - the root package exists primarily for
// workspace-level integration tests (e.g., markdown ASCII validation).
