# Example 5: Modern Activation Functions

This example demonstrates why modern activation functions (ReLU, GELU, Swish) are preferred over traditional Sigmoid activation, particularly for deep neural networks. The key issue is the **vanishing gradient problem**.

## The Problem: Vanishing Gradients

When training deep neural networks with Sigmoid or Tanh activations, gradients become extremely small as they propagate backward through layers. This causes two major problems:

1. **Learning stops**: Weights in early layers barely update (gradient ≈ 0)
2. **Deep networks fail**: Networks with 4+ layers cannot learn effectively

### Why Sigmoid Causes Vanishing Gradients

**Sigmoid function**: `f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))`

**Derivative**: `f'(x) = f(x) * (1 - f(x))`

The problem:
- When `x` is large positive: `f(x) ≈ 1`, so `f'(x) ≈ 1 * (1-1) = 0`
- When `x` is large negative: `f(x) ≈ 0`, so `f'(x) ≈ 0 * (1-0) = 0`
- **Maximum derivative** is only `0.25` (at `x=0`)

In a 4-layer network, gradients multiply: `0.25 × 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0039` → Learning is 256× slower!

## Modern Solutions

Modern activation functions solve this by maintaining **non-saturating gradients**:

| Activation | Range | Gradient | Best For |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Sigmoid** | (0, 1) | 0 to 0.25 | Shallow networks, output layer (binary classification) |
| **Tanh** | (-1, 1) | 0 to 1 | Shallow networks, RNNs (better than sigmoid) |
| **ReLU** | [0, ∞) | 0 or 1 | Most deep networks, default choice |
| **Leaky ReLU** | (-∞, ∞) | 0.01 or 1 | When ReLU neurons are "dying" |
| **GELU** | (-∞, ∞) | 0.1 to 1+ | Transformers (BERT, GPT, TRM) |
| **Swish** | (-∞, ∞) | 0.2 to 1+ | Very deep networks, smooth learning |

## Activation Functions Explained

### 1. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) ⭐

**Formula**: `f(x) = max(0, x)`

**Derivative**: `f'(x) = 1 if x > 0, else 0`

**Why it works**:
- Gradient is always 1 for positive values (no saturation!)
- Simple and fast to compute
- Sparse activation (~50% of neurons are zero)

**Pros**: Prevents vanishing gradients, fast, works great in practice
**Cons**: "Dying ReLU" problem (neurons can permanently die if `x < 0`)

**When to use**: Default choice for hidden layers in deep networks

---

### 2. Leaky ReLU

**Formula**: `f(x) = max(αx, x)` where `α = 0.01`

**Derivative**: `f'(x) = 1 if x > 0, else α`

**Why it works**:
- Like ReLU, but allows small negative values (`α * x` instead of 0)
- Prevents neurons from completely "dying"
- Gradient is never exactly zero

**Pros**: Fixes dying ReLU problem, maintains non-saturating gradients
**Cons**: Slightly more complex than ReLU

**When to use**: Very deep networks (10+ layers) where ReLU neurons are dying

---

### 3. GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) ⭐

**Formula (approximation)**: `f(x) ≈ 0.5 * x * (1 + tanh(√(2/π) * (x + 0.044715 * x³)))`

**Why it works**:
- Smooth, differentiable everywhere (unlike ReLU's sharp corner at 0)
- Stochastically regularizes by multiplying input by `Φ(x)` (Gaussian CDF)
- Non-monotonic (has small negative region)

**Pros**: State-of-the-art performance on many tasks, smooth gradients
**Cons**: Computationally more expensive than ReLU

**When to use**:
- **Transformers** (BERT, GPT, TRM)
- **Modern deep networks** when you want best performance
- Tasks requiring smooth non-linearity

---

### 4. Swish (SiLU - Sigmoid Linear Unit)

**Formula**: `f(x) = x * sigmoid(x) = x / (1 + e^(-x))`

**Derivative**: `f'(x) = σ(x) * (1 + x * (1 - σ(x)))`

**Why it works**:
- Self-gated: Uses its own value to gate itself
- Smooth, non-monotonic (like GELU)
- Works better than ReLU on very deep networks

**Pros**: Superior performance on deep networks, smooth
**Cons**: Slightly slower than ReLU

**When to use**: Very deep networks (10+ layers), when GELU is too expensive

---

### 5. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)

**Formula**: `f(x) = tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))`

**Derivative**: `f'(x) = 1 - tanh²(x)`

**Why it's better than Sigmoid**:
- Zero-centered (output range: -1 to 1)
- Stronger gradients than Sigmoid (max gradient = 1 vs 0.25)

**Why it's worse than ReLU**:
- Still suffers from vanishing gradients at extremes
- Saturates for large inputs

**When to use**: RNNs, shallow networks, when you need zero-centered outputs

---

## Network Visualization

This example generates visualizations of the XOR network before and after training using Sigmoid activation.

### Before Training (Random Weights)

The initial network has randomly initialized weights producing random outputs.

![XOR Network - Initial State](images/xor_sigmoid_initial.svg)

At this stage:
- Weights are randomly initialized
- Network produces ~50% accuracy (random guessing)
- No meaningful pattern in weight structure

### After Training (Learned XOR)

After 1528 iterations, the network perfectly learns the XOR function:

![XOR Network - Trained State](images/xor_sigmoid_trained.svg)

Key observations:
- **100% accuracy** on all 4 XOR cases
- **1528 iterations** to convergence
- Weights have organized into meaningful patterns
- Hidden layer neurons have specialized:
  - Some detect when inputs are **different** (output 1)
  - Others detect when inputs are **same** (output 0)

### What This Demonstrates

Even though Sigmoid suffers from vanishing gradients, it still works fine for **shallow networks** (3 layers). The vanishing gradient problem only becomes critical in deeper networks (4-6+ layers).

**For this shallow XOR network**:
- Sigmoid works perfectly fine
- Training is fast and reliable
- 100% accuracy is easily achieved

**For deep networks (4-6+ layers)**:
- Sigmoid would struggle (gradients vanish!)
- ReLU/GELU are essential
- Training would be much slower or fail

## Gradient Flow Comparison

This example demonstrates gradient behavior across different activation functions:

### Sigmoid - Vanishing Gradients

```
Output     Derivative
------     ----------
0.01       0.0099     ← Near zero!
0.50       0.2500     ← Maximum
0.99       0.0099     ← Near zero!
```

**Problem**: Gradients approach 0 at extremes. In deep networks, these tiny gradients multiply together, causing learning to stop.

### ReLU - Healthy Gradients

```
Output     Derivative
------     ----------
0.01       1.0000     ← Always 1 for positive!
0.50       1.0000
2.00       1.0000
```

**Solution**: Gradient is always 1 for positive values. No vanishing gradient problem!

### GELU - Smooth Healthy Gradients

```
Output     Derivative
------     ----------
0.01       1.0000     ← Healthy
0.50       1.0000
2.00       1.0000
```

**Best of both**: Smooth like Sigmoid, but maintains healthy gradients like ReLU.

5. **Try Leaky ReLU** if you see dying ReLU problem

## Mathematical Details

### Why ReLU Prevents Vanishing Gradients

In a deep network, gradients multiply as they propagate backward:

**Sigmoid (4 layers)**:
```
Final gradient = 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0039
Learning rate = 0.1 × 0.0039 = 0.00039  ← Too small!
```

**ReLU (4 layers)**:
```
Final gradient = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 1.0
Learning rate = 0.1 × 1.0 = 0.1  ← Perfect!
```

This is why ReLU networks train **256× faster** on deep architectures!

### GELU Intuition

GELU can be thought of as a smooth ReLU:
- Near 0: Smooth transition (not a sharp corner like ReLU)
- Positive values: Similar to ReLU (approximately `f(x) ≈ x`)
- Negative values: Small but non-zero (like Leaky ReLU, but smooth)

The smoothness helps with optimization in very deep networks.

## Extending This Example

### Try Different Network Depths

Modify the network to be deeper:

```rust
// Current (3 layers): 2 → 4 → 1
let mut network = FeedForwardNetwork::new(2, 4, 1);

// Deeper (5 layers): 2 → 8 → 6 → 4 → 1
// (Requires implementing multi-layer support)
```

**Experiment**: Try Sigmoid vs ReLU on 5+ layer networks. Sigmoid will struggle!

### Implement Per-Layer Activation Selection

Currently all layers use Sigmoid. Future enhancement:

```rust
let mut network = FeedForwardNetwork::builder()
    .input_layer(2)
    .hidden_layer(4, ReLU)
    .hidden_layer(4, GELU)
    .output_layer(1, Sigmoid)
    .build();
```

This is planned for Example-6 (Deeper Networks).
